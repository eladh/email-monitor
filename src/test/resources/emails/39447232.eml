Dwight., 
I noticed that when these are sent to VLS and TLC on a copy is edocs_submit@cassens.com. Edocs is only storing the email information for the first unit listed in the subject line. 
In this case below, when researching Edocs for HS508807 we find the email but if we are searching HS518145 we do not see the email. 
What is the workaround if possible to get the email to post in the folders inside edocs for each vin subjected?
